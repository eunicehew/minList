# minList
This is minList, a minimal list web application created using the MERN stack. The goal is to create a general use list app organized by pages containing sheets containing lists. Intended purely for personal development to gain familiarity with Redux and creation of reusable components. Features include:
- Multiple implementations of common components (pages, sheets, lists, items, dialogs, alerts)
- Authentication
- Redux persistence on refresh
- Sample category page/sheet creation on registration
- Drag and drop of items
- Inline text editing
- Dark Mode
- Reactivity of components
